# Multi-Class Chest X-Ray Classification for Respiratory Diseases

## Project Overview ðŸ“–

This project presents a deep learning solution for the automated diagnosis of respiratory diseases from chest X-ray images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built and trained to perform multi-class classification, distinguishing between four key categories: **COVID-19**, **Normal**, **Pneumonia**, and **Tuberculosis**. The goal is to create a fast and accurate tool to assist medical professionals in diagnosing these conditions.

## Dataset ðŸ“‚

The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images organized into four folders, each corresponding to one of the classes. All images are resized to a uniform `224x224` pixels before being fed into the network.

**Data Augmentation** is used to artificially expand the dataset and prevent overfitting. The following transformations are applied to the training images:
* Rotation
* Width and Height Shifts
* Shear transformations
* Zoom
* Horizontal Flipping

## Model Architecture ðŸ§ 

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of sequential convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.

* **Convolutional Layers:** Use `Conv2D` with the `ReLU` activation function to extract features like edges and textures from the images.
* **Max Pooling Layers:** `MaxPooling2D` layers are used to down-sample the feature maps, reducing computational complexity and making the model more robust to variations in feature positions.
* **Dropout Layer:** A `Dropout` layer is included to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
* **Flatten Layer:** This layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
* **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers that perform the final classification. The output layer uses a `softmax` activation function to produce a probability distribution over the four classes.

## Results and Evaluation ðŸ“Š

The model's performance was rigorously evaluated. An experiment was conducted to find the best optimizer, and the final model's performance was analyzed using a confusion matrix and a classification report.

### Optimizer Comparison

Different optimizers were compared based on their validation accuracy. The **Adam** optimizer demonstrated the best performance, achieving the highest accuracy among the tested options.

### Final Model Performance

The final model, trained with the Adam optimizer, shows excellent performance on the test set. The confusion matrix and classification report provide a detailed breakdown of its predictive accuracy for each class. The model demonstrates high precision and recall, especially for identifying 'NORMAL' and 'TUBERCULOSIS' cases.
